# docker-php-ipb
This was built of a stripped down docker of PHP/NGINX on alpine
It's been modified on the dockerfile to allow for Invision PoweBoards Forums to run within the docker and is expected you've extracted the forums to the HTML folder path.

The CHMOD commands will fail without the folders so comment them out and add them back in once you've extracted the ZIP files.
